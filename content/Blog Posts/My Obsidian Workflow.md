## Why Obsidian
If you didn‚Äôt heard Obsidian before, I advise you to check it out first to understand what it is. But if you don‚Äôt want to waste time and jut listen to me, I would say it is the **‚ÄúNOTE‚Äù** app for me. But what is different than the other apps?

1. **It is fully local and future-proof!** ‚û°Ô∏è Every file in the Obsidian is basically a *markdown (.md)* file and they are stored locally in your PC, phone. You can still continue to use Obsidian even if there was a global disaster worldwide. Moreover if Obsidian shut down itself, you can still use your notes. Because your files already stored locally as markdown files. Basically Obsidian works like an interpreter app, rather than an executive app.
2. **It is fully community based!** ‚û°Ô∏è There are hundreds of plugins, themes and custom css files to fully customize your Obsidian experience. And all of these are created by the community itself. Furthermore, [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/), [Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/obsidianmd) communities *(especially Discord community)* are very active and you can ask any question to find the solution for your problem.
3. **It is minimal as you want it to be!** ‚û°Ô∏è Maybe this point is not as important as the others but I think it deserves to be talked upon. There are hundreds of different Obsidian experience you can create and I don‚Äôt know if there is any other that is anywhere close to Obsidian about customization. You can literally change everything you want. Even if you don‚Äôt know any css, many LLMs have knowledge about Obsidian, so you can customize your experience by writing down what you want.

If you find at least one of the topics interesting and just wanted to write down stuff in a point if your life, just give Obsidian a chance and try it!

## My Obsidian Experience

I think you understand what does Obsidian do basically. But what is my Obsidian look like?

When one search the web and YouTube about Obsidian, it is very highly to see that lots of users are using it for Zettelkasten and PKM type of note taking stuff. Also, it is possible to see giant cluster of graphs (with lots of daily notes mostly). I need to say that my Obsidian is nothing like that. 

These are the things I use Obsidian for:
- Taking notes during lectures.
- Taking notes for the articles I read.
- Doing homeworks.
- Directly taking notes through Omnivore *(I will talk about this later on)*.
- Archiving books, articles, etc‚Ä¶
- Keep record of my work *(I‚Äôm working as a graphic artist)*.
- Writing stuff I want.


> [!info] Obsidian Type: Archiver
> For my workflow, I would say that my type of Obsidian user would be **archiver**. It is a made up word I found but it is suitable. Basically, I will track the things I do in Obsidian by lists and plugin. Moreover I will take important notes from the books and articles I read. Finally, I will write stuff up in Obsidian. If you don‚Äôt want to take excessive notes about what you do in your day or write down every stuff in your mind different notes, my system could be suitable for you! 

Nevertheless, I must state that this is how I use Obsidian, it is up to you to decide how you want to use it.
## Plugins

Without interfering with the overall experience much, I‚Äôm using lots of plugins to enhance my workflow. You might heard about *Dataview* and *Templater* before. In my opinion while they are very advanced plugins and indeed help people in specific topics, they are not must have plugins. Because they have a steep learning curve and most of the time users won‚Äôt need them. Therefore, I‚Äôm only using *Templater* and it is only for one thing, just using it to found out how many minutes are going to required for the document. 

Nevertheless, these are the plugins I use and why I use it:

- Advanced Tables ‚û°Ô∏è Adds a settings like panel for configuring tables, *not necessary but helpful for large table databases*.
- Better Word Count ‚û°Ô∏è Adds more options to find our the word count in the note.
- Calendar ‚û°Ô∏è Just adds a calendar to the right panel, *not necessary*. 
- DataLoom ‚û°Ô∏è It creates Notion like database tables, I‚Äôm using it to keep track the books I read.
- Emoji Toolbar ‚û°Ô∏è Adds a shortcut for emoji menu.
- Excalidraw‚≠ê‚û°Ô∏è Helps you to create amazing graphics for your notes. 
- File Explorer Count ‚û°Ô∏è Adds the data about how many notes are inside a folder.
- Force Note View Mode ‚û°Ô∏è Adds a properties so that you can force notes to open in reading mode.
- Iconize ‚û°Ô∏è Adds emojis to your folders.
- Image Toolkit ‚û°Ô∏è Adds new settings for images.
- List Callouts‚≠ê‚û°Ô∏è Adds shiny options for your bullet point lists to shine.
- Minimal Theme Settings ‚û°Ô∏è Just settings for the Minimal theme.
- Omnivore‚≠ê‚û°Ô∏è Basically Readwise but free. It is entagrated with your Omnivore account and store every highlight and notes directly into the Obsidian. If you are curious about it, you can check [my guide](Omnivore%20and%20Obsidian%20Omnivore%20Plugin.md) about it.
- Paste Image Rename ‚û°Ô∏è Make your pasted images more organized.
- Quick Latex ‚û°Ô∏è Makes writing math equations easier.
- Quick Add ‚û°Ô∏è Adds new automation tools for you. 
- Recent Files ‚û°Ô∏è Adds a new section in the left sidebar for last opened notes.
- Settings Search ‚û°Ô∏è Just like its name.
- Smart Typography ‚û°Ô∏è Just adds two small details for writing experience. Makes (‚Ä¶) and (‚Äú ‚Äù) more beautiful, not necessary.
- Style Settings ‚û°Ô∏è Adds additional settings for your themes.
- Templater ‚û°Ô∏è Adds many automation options for you.

## Custom CSS

While you may heard about plugins in Obsidian, you may not heard about the CSS customization it offers. I must say that I also learned about them after I started to use Obsidian and only after I started to use the Discord server. They are mostly used to enhance the aesthetics rather than new implementations on Obsidian. Like changing the colors of the folders, adding new callout types etc‚Ä¶ *(Nevertheless there are also some handy ones, like Dark PDF exporter)*. Also I must say that new LLM models like GPT4o and DeepSeek AI knows about this stuff, so feel free to use them to create new styles for your Obsidian experience *(Of course they have flaws but they can create simple stuff like changing the divider style)*.

These are the Custom CSSs I use:

- Custom Loading Screen ‚û°Ô∏è Makes the loading screen visually aesthetic.
- Custom Callout Size ‚û°Ô∏è Makes the callouts a little bit smaller.
- Dark PDF Export ‚û°Ô∏è Gives option to export notes with the dark interface.
- Delete Link Image ‚û°Ô∏è Deletes the little arrow image on the links.
- Custom Divider ‚û°Ô∏è Change the visual type of the divider.
- Rainbow Folders ‚û°Ô∏è Makes the folder names colorful!
- Custom Highlight ‚û°Ô∏è Makes the highlights round, *I don‚Äôt like the native highlight of the app*. 

This is the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/emomert/ObsidianCustomCss) if you want to inspect them.

This is why and how I use the Obsidian, I hope it will also help you to find how are going to use the Obsidian!

‚ùóI will try to improve this blog page in the future, sorry for not being in good qualityü•¥.
