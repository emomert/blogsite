> [!info] What is this page for?
> While I started to taking photos with my camera in 2019, I wasn’t really into photography. But recently I bought a [new camera](https://fujifilm-x.com/en-us/products/cameras/x100vi/) and I’m taking too many photos. Here you can find some of them! Please feel free to use them however you like. If the quality is not that great, feel free to reach me via mail or some other way!

> *Note:* I like to name the photos I took. Mostly I try to be creative and funny when giving these names! Unfortunately they are mostly in Turkish but I will translate the ones that can be translated!

> [!tldr] Why There are Separate Folders?
> I decided to use different notes for different settings of photos I took. Because there were lots of photos, I think this was the best decision! Nevertheless, these are my favourite ones, I will try to place relatively less photo in my favourite photos part!
