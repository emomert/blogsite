Welcome to my web page. My name is Mert Oruntak and I'm an economics student in Boğaziçi University. I’m trying to educate myself in distinct areas, mainly Blockchain, socialism, and LLMs. If you want to know more about me, you can check [[About Me]].

I will use this site mainly publish my writings and etc… My main reason to open up a webpage was because of the self-motivation. Since my childhood, I always liked to write something but I actually never tried to write to myself only besides homework and job related stuff. I feel like if I can open up a web page to myself I will have more will to write! Let’s hope so!

I just started to use here so there is not much stuff in here. I’m trying to release new stuff so feel free to check in some time later! Thank you for visiting 🙏
